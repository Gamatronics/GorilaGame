# GorilaGame
Trying to replicate a really old game that I once play, no idea what language it was programmed on.
Two players try take truns trying to hit each other with bullets, each player selects a force and an angle and shoot.
I plan to incclude gravity and wind effects.
This is in it's very early stages, still, mostly to learn PyGame than anything else.
